# US 012 - To import information from a legacy system

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a system administrator, I want to import information from a legacy  system that has been in use in several agencies.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Import information from a legacy
system that has been in use in several agencies.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**  In the legacy File provided, on the Location, I assume that the structure of the cell is: Address, City, State, and postal code. Assuming that this is the right structure, shouldn't the districts of the cities be there as well?
>  
> **Answer:** Please check carefully the legacy file. For instance, in line 5 we get "71 ST. NICHOLAS DRIVE, NORTH POLE, FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR,  AK, 99705". When loading the data, you should consider location addresses with and without district info.


> **Question:**  From the provided CSV file, our team infers that this feature is meant to import data related to announcements only and not other data like, for example, employee information. Is this correct?
>  
> **Answer:** The System Administrator should be able to load any file with the extension csv. The file content must be validated, showing a message to the system
administrator if the file is empty or its content is not in the requested format.

> **Question:**  Also, in relation to AC2, can we assume that a CSV file is any file whose filename ends with ".csv"?
