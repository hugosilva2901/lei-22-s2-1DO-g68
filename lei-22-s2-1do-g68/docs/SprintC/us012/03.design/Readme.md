| Step 1  		 | 	... interacting with the actor?              | ImportLegacySystemDataUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * CSVLoader
 * LegacySystemData

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * ImportLegacySystemDataUI  
 * ImportLegacySystemDataController
