As an network manager, I want to list all the employees working in every store of the network.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost as well as the its classifying task category. 


>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**  Do you want a list where the header is ID, the name of the store, and the total number of listings that the store has?
>  
> **Answer:** Yes.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The list of employees should be alphabetically sorted and grouped by store
* **AC2:** Stores should be sorted according to their property listings, from the one with more listings to the one with less listings.
