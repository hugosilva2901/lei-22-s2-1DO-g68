# US 005 - To register a Store 

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a system administrator, I want to register a store.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each store in the network has a store manager and the set of stores is managed by a store network
manager.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Does a store designation have to be detailed?
>  
> **Answer:** The ID is an integer number. An example of the store location is: 71 ST. NICHOLAS DRIVE, NORTH POLE, FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR, AK, 99705. An example phone number is (907) 488-6419.


> **Question:** When a System Administrator (admin) makes a request to register a new employee or a new network branch (or any other alteration), does the System ask for the admin credentials (login, password)?
>  
> **Answer:** The System Administrator should be logged in the application.

> **Question:** To register an employee I need to allocate him with a branch. To register a branch I need an employee (to be local manger) but I can't create the employee because I have no branch and I canâ€™t create the branch because I have no employee.
>
> **Answer:**  Thank you for identifying this issue. We already updated the project description. When a store is created in the system, the System Administrator should not set the Store Manager.
When registering a store, the System Administrator should introduce the following information: an ID, a designation/name, a location, a phone number and an e-mail address.

> **Question:** Could you please share how will the designation of new stores be made, is there a pattern perhaps?
> 
> **Answer:**  There is no pattern. The System Administrator can introduce any designation/name. The designation/name should have at most forty characters.

> **Question:** Will the System Administrator be able to choose a location from a list of available locations (defined elsewhere in the application) or will he be able to submit any location he wants?
>
> **Answer:**  The System Administrator can submit any location.
