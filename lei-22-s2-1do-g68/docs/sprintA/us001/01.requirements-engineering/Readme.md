### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost as well as the its classifying task category. 


>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**  Is the client able to sort properties by only these 4 criteria (type, number of rooms, price,location) or is he able to sort properties by any of the properties' characteristics?
>  
> **Answer:** The client should be able to select the type of business (renting or buying), the type of property and the number of rooms. Then, the client should be able to sort properties by price or by parish where the property is located.
If the client does not select the type of business, the type of property and the number of rooms, the application should allow the client to sort all properties that are on sale or on renting.
