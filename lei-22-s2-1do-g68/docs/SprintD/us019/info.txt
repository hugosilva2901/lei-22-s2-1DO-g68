The time complexity of the brute-force algorithm for partitioning the stores into two subsets and finding the minimum difference can be analyzed as follows:

Generating Partitions: The algorithm generates all possible partitions of the stores. For n stores, there are a total of 2^(n-1) - 2 partitions. Therefore, the time complexity of generating partitions is O(2^n).

Finding Minimum Difference: For each generated partition, the algorithm calculates the sums of the elements in the two subsets and finds the minimum difference. Since there are 2^(n-1) - 2 partitions, the time complexity for finding the minimum difference is O(2^n).

Overall Time Complexity: The dominant factor in the algorithm's time complexity is the generation of partitions, which has a time complexity of O(2^n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(2^n).

It's important to note that the brute-force algorithm has an exponential time complexity, which means the execution time grows rapidly as the number of stores increases. For small input sizes, this algorithm may be feasible, but for larger input sizes, it may become impractical due to its high computational cost.
