# US 006 - To create a Task 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an agent, I intend to see the list of property announcement requests made to myself, so that I can post the announcement.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**
An agent views the pending announcement requests sorted by the date they were created, with the most recent 
requests appearing first. An announcement is posted once a request is accepted. The list of requests should be 
refreshed, and the accepted request should no longer be displayed.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** About US08, since as an agent I intend to see the advertisement 
> requests made to me in order to publish the chosen advertisement after consulting 
> the list, why should there be an option to reject it since the previously chosen 
> advertisement had already the intention of being published.The rejection operation 
> shouldn't be described as another feature?
>  
> **Answer:** I want to check all property announcement requests and have the option to 
> accept or reject any announcement request. The property owner is a human being and can 
> make errors like any other human being...


> **Question:** besides the creation of a message justifiyng the rejection should a message or an email be sent to the client.
> 
> **Answer:** The system should also send the message to the owner by e-mail.

> **Question:** Does the request once its declined by the agent be deleted from the request list?
> 
> **Answer:** The announce request should not be shown again to the agent. We never delete information from our system.

> **Question:** Do the agent have to insert the commission after accepting the request from the request list?
> 
> **Answer:** The agent should, firstly, set the commission and then publishes the offer in the system. 
> The sale price (the USD value that is shown in the announcement) should include the commission value 
> (owner requested price + commission) and should not show the commission. The commission is only specified 
> when the agent accepts the request.

> **Question:** Does the customer have any say in setting the commission (agree or deny, eg: commission too high so I 
> withdraw the ad request) or is the commission solely set by the agent without customer approval?
> Assuming that and that the agent accepts the ad request:
> Does he set the commission and post the ad?
> or
> does he set the commission, and wait for customer approval?
> Taking that into account, what happens when the agent accepts the advertisement request:
> Is the commission defined, is the ad registered and is feedback from the customer expected on the commission?
> or
> the agent sets the commission and the ad is published automatically?
> 
> **Answer:**  The agent should, firstly, set the commission and then publishes the offer in the system. 
> The sale price (the USD value that is shown in the announcement) should include the commission value 
> (owner requested price + commission) and should not show the commission. The commission is only specified 
> when the agent accepts the request.

> **Question:**  Is the owner responsible to assigning the property to an agent or there are other ways to do that?
>
> **Answer:**  In US8 we get "As an agent, I intend to see the list of property announcement requests made to myself, 
> so that I can post the announcement". In this US the agent is the actor.
> The owner chooses the responsible agent in one other US. Please discuss this question with your teammates and teatchers.

> **Question:**  In this US8, will it be necessary to show search criteria? If so, which ones?
>
> **Answer:**  There is no search criteria.

> **Question:** Regarding US008, can the agent decline an announcement request?
> 
> **Answer:**  Yes. The agent must include a message justifying the rejection.

> **Question:** Can the agent select multiple requests at the same time?
> 
> **Answer:**  No. The agent can only post one announcement at a time.

> **Question:** When displaying the property announcement requests in the system to the agent besides 
> them being ordered from most recent to oldest is there a need to display the specific day where the 
> requests were published?
>
> **Answer:**  The list of property announcement requests should be sorted by the date they were created, 
> with the most recent requests appearing first. The system should show the date when the property announcement 
> requests was made.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The list of property announcement requests should be sorted by the date they were created, with the most recent requests appearing first.
* **AC2:** An announcement is posted when a request is accepted. The list of requests should be refreshed, and that request should not be shown again.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency on 'US002: As an agent, I can publish any sale announcement on the system, for example, received through a phone call' because at least one announcement must exist in order to associate it with an agent.
