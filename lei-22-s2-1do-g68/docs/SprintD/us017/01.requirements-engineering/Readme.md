# US17: As a network manager, I want to list all deals made. 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a network manager, I want to list all deals made.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Can you confirm that we are analyzing the deals made in all the branches all together?
> 
> **Answer:**   Yes, we are analyzing the deals made in all the branches all together.

> **Question:** In this User Story it is requested that "All deals made" are listed. Are these deals just accepted purchase requests, or are declined purchase requests also included?
>
> **Answer:** A deal takes place when the proposed purchase/renting is accepted.

> **Question:** What should be the default order of the deals when displaying them to the network manager?
> the entire list of properties to sale?
> 
> **Answer:** The default is to sort deals from the most recent ones to the oldest ones.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The actor should be able to sort all properties by property area (square feet)
  in descending/ascending order.
* **AC2:** Two sorting algorithms should be implemented (to be chosen manually by
  the network manager).
* **AC3:** Worst-case time complexity of each algorithm should be documented in the
  application user manual that must be delivered with the application (in the
  annexes, where algorithms should be written in pseudocode).
### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency on order
